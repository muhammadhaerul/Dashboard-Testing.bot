Paper.id Social Club The Paper.id Social Club is a place where Astronauts can enjoy their hobbies and interests after work. 
These activities happen outside of regular work hours, based on agreements within each club. The main purpose is to boost interaction among employees and strengthen connections among Astronauts, 
especially between different departments. 
Paper Social Club merupakan sebuah program dimana Astronauts dapat membentuk sebuah club sesuai dengan minat dan bakat yang dimiliki. Program ini tentunya akan memfasilitasi komunikasi dan hubungan antar divisi agar Astronauts dapat bertumbuh bersama sebagai satu keluarga besar 👨🏻‍🚀👩🏼‍🚀
