I need to study more
I will study daily to continually improve my grades, proven by my quizzes, in chemistry to graduate at the top of my class in one year.
I want to publish more blog posts on my website.
Starting next week, I will post a 1,500-word article on my blog each week for a year, culminating in fifty-two blog posts and increased traffic to my site.
I want to get fit again.
Next week, I’ll begin working out every day with a personal trainer and we will continually track my fitness goals. I’ll be under 10% body fat and ready to run the Boston Marathon within eight months.

The Fundamentals of OKR:
Key elements and things to avoid

5 Key Elements of OKR
1. FOCUS
2. ALIGN
3. COMMITMENT
4. TRACKING
5. STRETCHING

Common OKR Mistakes:
1. Business as Usual OKRs
2. Sandbagging
3. Lack of alignment

How to Create Goal Setting Based on OKR
Steps to Set OKRs:
1. Identify a North Star, or top-level Objective.
2. Set Objectives and narrow it down to the most important 1 to 2 for now.
3. Set Key Results and narrow it down to the most important 2 to 5 for now.
4. Align The OKRs.

Setting Objectives:
- Is the Objective aligned with the goals of the company/organization?
- Will the company want to work toward this Objective?
- Is it ambitious enough to push the team a little harder?
- Will it advance the company or organization overall?
- Does the Objective serve to guide the team, or would it make things more confusing?

Setting Key Results:
- Does the Key Result lead to achieving your Objective?
- Is this Key Result the most efficient way toward achieving your Objective, or is there a more appropriate one?
- Is this possible with the current staff capacity?
- Does it complement the capabilities of the company?
- Do you have a system in place to periodically track and measure the Key Results?

Goal-setting Comprises...
Objective: Improving Hiring Speed by having significant Employer Branding activation by end of Q4.
Key Result 1: To have 6 employer branding events with targeted universities by end of Q4.
Key Result 2: Increasing referral program from 20% to 40% by end of Q4.
+ Metrics: Number of event completions.
+ Metrics: % of hiring referral generated.

Cascading Approach
Dept Objective → Team Objective → Individual Objective

Options when crafting your objective + key result (depending on your role):
1. Directly take your Dept’s / Team’s objective + key result as your own.
2. Directly take your Dept’s / Team’s objective and craft your own objectives.
3. Directly take key result of your Dept/Team and use as the Objective + craft your own Key Result.

Approach 1:
Directly take your Dept’s / Team’s objective + key result as your own.
Example: Reduce Infrastructure Downtime by end of Q1.
Key Result: Achieve 99.99% uptime for all production systems by end of Q1.

Approach 2:
Directly take your Dept’s / Team’s Objective and craft your own key result.
Example: Make a radically smooth user onboarding and activation experience in Q1 2024.
Key Result: Increase profile completion rate from 20% to 85% by end of Q1 2024.

Approach 3:
Directly take key result of your Dept/Team and use as the Objective + craft your own Key Result.
Example: Improve data accuracy rate from 80% to 95% in data quality checks by end of Q1 2023.
Key Result: Reduce data entry errors by 20% through process improvements and automation by W2 Feb 2023.

Setting Your Objective & Key Result:
Team/Dept Objective: Reduce Infrastructure Downtime by end of Q1.
Key Result: Achieve 99.99% uptime for all production systems by end of Q1.

Team/Dept Objective: Make a radically smooth user onboarding and activation experience in Q1 2024.
Key Result: Reduce churn through onboarding funnel steps 3 and 4 from 60% to 20% by end of Q1 2024.

How to Measure:
Approach 1: Output Basic measurement metrics.
Approach 2: Outcome/Impact.
Approach 3: Efficiency Optimization.

For the objective you have selected, there are a few ways you can measure it.
- SLA
- Error Rate
- CSAT
- eNPS
- Retention
- Time for taken ticket resolution

Weightage Your OKR:
1. How much direct influence do you have over these Objective & Key Result?
2. Does the weighting reflect the priorities of the department?

Each objective key result min weight of 5% (& in multiples of 5%). Anything less than this is insignificant and does not move the needle. Total weight of all objective key result is 100%.

Let’s Design the OKR!

Let’s Check Our OKR Comprehension

OKR EXAMPLE #2 - Why it's wrong? It’s not specific, vague, and unquantifiable so it can’t be tracked.
- Make our company go viral: 10%
- Generate 100,000 views in our YouTube channel: 10%
- Increase organic search traffic to our website by 20%: 10%
- Get more Instagram followers: 10%

OKR EXAMPLE #1 - Why it's wrong? It’s not specific, vague, and not the most efficient way toward achieving the Objective.
- Achieve record 3rd quarter revenue growth: 10%
- Generate $100k in new revenue: 10%
- Reduce customer churn in the first quarter from 15% to 10%: 10%
- Onboard 300 new clients: 10%
- Launch new line of business: 10%

OKR EXAMPLE #4 - Why it's wrong? It’s not OKR. Rather a project with a task list. Key results are not tasks to be achieved. It should describe outcomes, not activities.
- Implement new outbound email campaign: 10%
- Write email copy to send to outbound leads: 10%
- Get a list of outbound leads: 10%
- Send email to everyone on the list: 10%

OKR EXAMPLE #5 - Let’s say that the C-Levels of an online grocery company set the following company-wide OKR:
- Become the leading online grocery in the region by 2023: 10%
- Makeup 60% of all SKU sales in the region: 10%
- Reach 90% customer satisfaction for operational service: 10%
- Increase brand visibility by 50 percent: 10%
- Open second location by the end of the year: 10%

OKR EXAMPLE #5.1:
- Makeup 60% of all SKU sales in the region by end of 2023: 10%
- Hire 2 new Area Sales Managers in Q1 2023: 10%
- Increase the number of SKU sold by 55% over the last year by end of 2023: 10%
- Increase the sales revenue by 40% over the last year by end of 2023: 10%
- Implement monthly sales promotion: 10%

OKR EXAMPLE #5.2:
- Increase the number of SKU sold by 55% over the last year by end of 2023: 10%
- Speak to at least 50 potential customers a month: 10%
- Successfully close at least 12 sales a month: 10%
