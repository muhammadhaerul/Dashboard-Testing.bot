Asking & Giving Feedback
Asking - Receiving - Taking

Feedback is like a gift:
- Some people really think about it before giving it.
- Some people are expecting it.
- But, sometimes it’s a good thing but in bad packaging.

Sharing Time:
- Pernahkah dapat feedback yang tidak menyenangkan dan berujung kesal?
- Pernahkah saat memberi feedback, yang menerima malah merespon negatif dan bikin moment jadi ga enak?

Feedback is something we need to learn.

1on1 Coaching Guideline
If your team is:
- Underperforming: What do you need right now to perform to the best of your ability?
- Overperforming: What do you like best about your work? What are the things you’d like to improve/gain experience on?

Follow-up Questions:
- What’s your aspiration? What kind of roles/projects you’d like to aim for next?

1on1 Coaching Guideline for Specific Scenarios:
1. Having conflict w/ others:
   - Tell me about a conflict you have with…
   - What do you think the root cause is and how would you like to resolve this?

2. Having troubles in setting priorities/managing time:
   - You seemed to have troubles in managing priorities. Tell me why you think the reason is.

3. Burnout/Stressed out:
   - You seemed stressed out. Tell me why and let me know how I can help.

Coaching Exercise (20 mins):
Now, get in pairs.
Choose roles:
- 1 as giver.
- 1 as the one who asks for a Coaching session.

Circle of Influence:
