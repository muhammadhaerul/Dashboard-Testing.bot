WHY, HOW, WHAT
WHY is a purpose, cause, or belief. It’s the very reason your self exists.
HOW: The way you do it. These are the things that make you special or set you apart from your competitor.
Every person on the planet knows WHAT they do. The choices, the activity, or service they give.

Leadership Styles:
- Autocratic (authoritarian): The leader makes all of the decisions and the followers are expected to follow orders and execute without question.
- Democratic (participative): The leader involves followers in the decision-making process. Often the leader may still make the final decision but input from group members is encouraged in order to reach a decision.
- Laissez-faire (delegative): Leaders delegate decision-making authority to their followers and allow them to work largely on their own.

There’s not one-size-fits-all leadership style: depends on your team’s capabilities, readiness, and situation.

Case Study: Tim Cook (Apple Inc)
Tim Cook - CEO Apple Inc per 2011
- Tim Cook took over the job of CEO of Apple from Steve Jobs in 2011 and has now helmed the company for over a decade.
- His managerial style is said to be democratic, in sharp contrast to Jobs's autocratic style.
- Cook fosters cooperation among Apple's talent and encourages consensus-building among high-level employees.
- Despite the lack of a market-changing product, like the iPod or iPhone, Cook has continued to run Apple as a successful company.

Under Tim Cook, Apple became the first company to reach a $1 trillion market capitalization. Under his watch, it also became the first company to hit a $3 trillion market cap.
