The System Flow Pluto Points:  
Pluto points are a fantastic way to recognize and reward teamwork on real projects within our company! Successfully completing a project makes you eligible to earn points. Here's the exciting twist: you can earn Pluto points by receiving appreciation from your peers for your hard work on the project, or by giving appreciation to others who have made significant contributions.

How to Earn Pluto Points:  
It's a two-way street! Both the person receiving appreciation and the person giving it will be rewarded with Pluto points!

1. Givers can only earn points for one project per day.  
   This means you can't get points for the same project multiple times in a single day.
2. Appreciation must be tied to contributions made on real projects.  
   You can only earn points for recognizing someone's work on actual projects, not for things outside of project work.
3. Daily Point Limits:  
   - The receiver of appreciation can earn up to 5 Pluto points per day.  
   - The giver can earn a maximum of 1 Pluto point per day.
4. Misuse of the System:  
   If you misuse the system, you might receive a friendly reminder and a temporary pause on earning points. Be sure to use the system fairly and honestly.

How to Redeem Pluto Points:  
Ready to reap the rewards of your teamwork? Head over to the Linktree link to browse exciting rewards you can redeem with your Pluto points! It typically takes 5 working days to receive your rewards after redemption. Think of Pluto points like a spending currency. When you redeem a reward, the points you use are deducted from your total balance. For example, if you have 20 points and redeem a reward that costs 10 points, your remaining balance will be 10 points. After claiming the reward, you cannot claim the same reward again until the system resets to Q1 of the next year.

Requirements of Appreciation to Count as Pluto Points:  
For Pluto points, create a creative shout-out to a teammate (message, meme, or photo) highlighting their contribution. Remember to include both your and their names! The following elements are essential:

1. Creative Shout-Out:  
   It must be a personalized message specifically for a teammate.
2. Content:  
   Use a heartfelt message, funny meme, or celebratory photo.
3. Acknowledgement:  
   Highlight their contribution to the team.
4. Recognition is Two-Way:  
   Mention both your name (giver) and your teammate's name (receiver).

PLUTO ANSWER  
Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)

1. How to Earn Pluto Points?  
   There are two ways to earn Pluto points: as a giver or a receiver of appreciation through Padlets (Appreciation Center).

2. How to Redeem Pluto Points?  
   Redeeming your Pluto points is easy! Just scan the QR code and head over to the "Redeem" section. Fill out the necessary information and then sit back and relax – your rewards will be on their way to you in about 5 working days.

3. How can our Padlets count as Pluto Points?  
   Your Padlets qualify for Pluto Points if the project is well-received, has a creative title, identifies a recipient, and the sender meets all other terms and conditions. You can find the terms and conditions on Linktree.

4. Why didn’t my Padlets count as Pluto Points?  
   Your Padlets likely didn’t meet the terms and conditions or follow the do’s and don’ts. But that’s okay! You can contact the project lead to understand why your Padlets weren’t counted. You have 24 hours to revise them after receiving a response from the project lead.

5. What is the duration of the pause imposed for misuse of the campaign?  
   To ensure the program's effectiveness and fairness for all participants, we kindly ask you to familiarize yourself with the Pluto Point usage guidelines. In the event of any unintentional misuse, we will follow a tiered approach:  
   - The first offense will result in a gentle reminder to clarify proper usage.  
   - Subsequent offenses may result in a temporary pause on earning new Pluto Points, with the duration increasing for repeated occurrences.  

   Note: Any Pluto Points you have already earned will remain in your account and will not be impacted. By following these guidelines, you can continue to participate in the program and be rewarded for your contributions.

Disclaimer:  
We reserve the right to modify the rules and rewards of this campaign at any time without providing prior notice. These changes may include adjustments to the point system, eligibility criteria, or available rewards. To optimize the campaign and ensure its effectiveness, we may occasionally make adjustments to the rules and rewards based on participant behavior, feedback, and ongoing campaign performance.
