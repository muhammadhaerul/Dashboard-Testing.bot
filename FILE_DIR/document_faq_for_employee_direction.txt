FAQ for Employee Direction:
1. How to calculate annual leave balance? 
Your annual l eave period at PAPER.ID is from Jan 1 - Dec 31, with a monthly cutoff on the 15th. 
Each year, employees get a total of 12 leaves, appearing monthly based on their join date. 
For example, Lisa joined on March 15, 2023, therefore, her leave balance by Nov 31, 2023, is 9. 

2. Can annual leave be carried over to the next year? 
Yes, as of Nov 2023, any remaining leaves at the end of Dec can be carried over up to 6 days, usable until the end of June the following year. 
The rest will expire. 

3. What are the changes in leave rules? 
Previously, your leave balance is counted starting from your join date and expired if unused. 
The transition to the new system starts counting from the old system's cutoff in Dec 2023, prorated. 
For instance, Ana joined on Aug 5, 2022; her old leave period was Aug 5, 2022 - Aug 4, 2023. 
The remaining leaves by Dec 31, 2023, are carried forward. 

4. Can unused leave be converted to cash? 
No, unused leave will expire as per the rules. 

5. What is replacement off? 
Due to specific cases, it's a special leave for employees required to work on holidays. 
Approval (including from C-Level) is needed. 

6. Attendance schedule: 
All employees must adhere to a default schedule of 9 am - 6 pm (8 work hours, 1-hour break). 
*Some departments follow a roster. 

7. Can there be attendance outside normal hours? 
Yes, with prior notification and approval from HR, ensuring a minimum of 9 work hours daily. 
Verification is done by the 20th of each month. 

8. Is self photo in attendance mandatory? 
Yes, it's mandatory for accurate attendance tracking. 

9. Will reimbursement be done through GAJI.ID? 
Yes, reimbursement will be done through GAJI.ID, with details communicated separately by the Finance team. 

10. What to do If the leave balance is incorrect? 
You can contact Ailsa Aurellia via Slack. 

11. How about leave applied before Nov 21, 2023 for later use? 
Resubmit the leave request on Gaji.ID if it's to be used after Nov 21, 2023. 

12. Issues with GAJI.ID account? 
You can contact Ailsa Aurellia via Slack. 

13. The valid leave period referred to, is it the period of usage or the period of taking? 
The applicable leave period is the actual leave period, not the time taken/requested. 
For example, 
Scenario A: Pada Oktober 2023, Alex memiliki total 8 hari cuti yang dapat digunakan. 
Namun, rencana liburan Alex baru akan berlangsung pada Februari 2024. 
Sayangnya, aturan perusahaan menyatakan bahwa cuti yang dimiliki harus digunakan dalam satu periode kalender, yaitu dari 1 Januari hingga 31 Desember. 
Oleh karena itu, pengajuan cuti untuk Februari 2024 tidak dapat dilakukan karena melebihi periode cuti yang berlaku. 
Scenario B: Setelah diterapkan kebijakan carry over, Alex memiliki kesempatan untuk memperpanjang penggunaan cutinya hingga 6 hari untuk tahun berikutnya, dengan batas maksimal penggunaan hingga Juni 2024. 
Dengan menerapkan carry over, Alex dapat menggunakan 6 hari cuti pada tahun berikutnya (memotong dari sisa cuti tahun sebelumnya). 
Namun, 2 hari sisanya harus digunakan dalam periode tahun sebelumnya yaitu 31 Desember 2023. 

14. Can probationary employees take leave? 
Leave becomes available after passing probation, but the balance is calculated from the join date (therefore, after you passed your probation, your annual leave balance will be 3 days). 

15. Leave approval process: 
Upon leave request, the immediate supervisor receives a notification for approval/rejection. 

16. Are permissions (izin) still valid? 
No, permissions are not applicable; you may use your annual leave for any personal or business matters. 

17. Do employees on leave receive meal allowance? 
No, meal allowances are only for working days, not applicable during any kind of leave.
